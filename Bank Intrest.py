#Task 2: Bank Interest If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, 
# calculate the total amount in your account after a year.
# So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell us the amount at the end of the year.
# For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.

start_amount =10700
ir = .07
total = start_amount*ir+start_amount
print (total)
